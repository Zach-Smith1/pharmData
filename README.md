# pharmData
💊📊🧐

- Place all the functions you want to run in the run.js file

- Alter, comment out, or delete lines of code from run.js as desired

- Then open the terminal (in vscode open built in terminal with ctrl + `) and from within pharmData folder run:
```
node run
```

- Adding " ndc" to the above command in the CLI will cause the createSpreadsheetData function to only include NDCs found in allNDCs.txt

- Relevant data will be logged and (if createSpreadsheetData was run) output files will be created within pharmData folder
