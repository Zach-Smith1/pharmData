💊📊🧐

- Place all the functions you want to run in the run.js file

- Alter, comment out, or delete lines of code from run.js as desired

- Then open the terminal (in vscode open built in terminal with ctrl + `) and from within pharmData folder run
```
node run
```

- For unit tests edit test.js file and run
```
node test
```
  to see results logged to the console
